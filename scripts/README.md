2. Generate the changelog with this script: [https://trello.com/c/uspnIWkh/1566-release-note](https://trello.com/c/uspnIWkh/1566-release-note)
3. Clean the generated changelog, to match the format of [https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/releases](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/releases).
4. Update the root /package.json's version
5. `yarn release:version`

7. Merge PR once CI is green and it has been approved
